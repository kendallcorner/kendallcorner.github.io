## Learning Program

I am most familar with Python and JavaScript, so I am going to focus on those two languages. Here is where I want to start.

## Free Code Camp

{% link "Free Code Camp" https://learn.freecodecamp.org %} has some very beginner lessons, but it also has some more advanced information, and it seems like an excellent resource to fill in the gaps. I will be going through the curriculum and skipping items that seem rudimentary or that I already know. I'd like to cover lessons like:

1. ~~Review any gaps in basic HTML and CSS~~
2. ~~Flexbox, Responsive design,~~ CSS Grid, Assessibility, Responsive Web Design Projects
2. Review of JS algorithms and datastructures
3. Front End Libraries
4. Data Visualization
5. APIs and microservices
6. Information Security



## What I want to learn next:

### Databases

1. {% link "The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert" https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/ %}  
 

2. {%link "MySQL tutorial" http://zetcode.com/databases/mysqltutorial/ %}  

### Flask and Django

1. {%link "REST APIs with Flask and Python" https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/ %}  


2. {%link "Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp" https://www.udemy.com/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/ %}  

### A stack with React or other JavaScript

1. {% link "This course" https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-react %}
